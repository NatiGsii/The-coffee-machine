# The-coffee-machine

The program required to provide a quarter, dime, nickles, and pennies of the American coins.

# If you provide enough the machine will pour the desired hot beverage.

# The program can also print a report if you ask for a report just by typing 'report'.

# Maintenance guys secretly can type 'off' in order to switch the machine and fix issues.

# Enjoy your favorite drink and let me know if there are any bugs inside.
